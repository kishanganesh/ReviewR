## Installation

ReviewR has adopted an R package framework, thanks to the excellent [golem package](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) developed by ThinkR. As such, installing and running ReviewR should be a breeze. 

To install the latest development release:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('thewileylab/ReviewR')
```

ReviewR is now installed as a package and can be run from your local machine. To begin, just run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ReviewR::run_app()
```
